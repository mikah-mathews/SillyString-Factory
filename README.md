## Setup/Installation Requirements
  
1. Follow the instruction on this [website](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/mysql-tutorial/mysql-workbench-installation) for installing MySQL server, MySQL Workbench, and MySQL shell.  
2. Clone the repository to your desktop and open your terminal then Navigate to the downloaded project by typing "cd (project-name)"
3.  Open project in your desired text editor. I recommend [visual studio code.](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
4. Add a new file called `appsettings.json` in the project's production folder and store the following
        `{
            "ConnectionStrings": {
                "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[NAME-OF-THE-DATABASE-YOU-CREATED-ABOVE];uid=root;pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE];"
            }
        }`
5. Create your own database from the .sql file located in the projects top most level by following these steps: 
  
    1. Type "dotnet restore" in Terminal then hit enter
    2. Enter "dotnet build" to Terminal
    3. Type "dotnet ef migration add InitialCreate" followed by enter
    4. Type "dotnet ef database update" then hit enter    
6. Once in the project's production folder, type "dotnet watch run" in the terminal - then navigate to your web browser and type http://localhost:5000/ in your url bar to see the application.
